# Weather-Journal App Project

# Name: Noran Thabet

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions

[first] I have made some modifictions;
let's start with [server.js] or[local server]=>

1) I've installed <express> , <cors>,<body-parser>and <json> packages,cause we should require express() in our local server.

2) then I've setup the localhost to make sure the server is running and producing feedback through a working callback function.

3)I've made GET routes and POST routeswith callback function to create at the top of server code.

[secand]=>make some modifactions in <app.js>

1) I've created an account in [openWeatherMap.com] to obtain the <baseURl> and my <apiKey> to pass as a parameter to {fetch()}
	
2)I used asynchronous function to fetch the data from the [app endpoint].

3)I used [.then] to chain that makes a POST request and update UI .
by implementing async calling by the use of promise chaining where passing the mix [API] and user responses to[ POST routes] in the server side.

4)I used  event[.addEventListener()] to the button <generate> when clicked it obtain the defined data from the API.

5)I have updated UI dynamically included in async function to retrieve the [app's data] existing in client server and the selected element contain[.innerHTML] to set dynmaically according to data returned by the <app route>
	
[finally]=> I've made some modification in <HTML> and <css> sheets	
changing the <font> ,<styles> and background
